# Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC)

PARC presents a parallelizable motion-planning framework for the reach-avoid problem in autonomous robotics, guaranteeing both safety and liveness. It models the planning dynamics as a parameterized piecewise-affine system, allowing for the computation of a continuum of feasible motion plans through a precise backward reachability analysis. The utility of PARC is demonstrated across various robotics systems, where it is benchmarked against leading reach-avoid methods, showcasing its superiority in low conservatism.

## Navigating this Repo
### Tutorial
`demo` folder provides you a step-by-step guide how to write your own PARC algorithm via learning example of turtlebot 2D navigation and nearhover 3D navigation.

### Directory Structure
1. `agents`: Abstraction for the tracking model (e.g., Turtlebot)
2. `TrajectoryModel`: Abstraction for the planning model (e.g., Dubins Car)
3. `utils`: Collection of useful operations as visualization, set operation, sampling, that is agnostic to choice of tracking model and planning model.
